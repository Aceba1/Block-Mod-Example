# BlockMod-Example
This is for use with the Nuterra BlockInjector Library to create your own modded block using code.

## Preparation
Open up the project in Visual Studio.

In the Solution Explorer commonly to the right, find the `References` folder and right-click it. Click `Add Reference...`

In the new window, click Browse at the bottom right. Go to your TerraTech_Data/Managed folder in the install directory, and select the Unity files. (You may need to use the older Unity Files)
Add the files, and re-open Browse. Find the Block Inject Mod in the QMods folder.

Remember to modify the mod.json to make it unique!

## Using
To compile / build your mod, press CTRL SHIFT B.
The compiled mod folder will be in a folder called `Built` at the base of the repository. (If unchanged in Properties, it will be called `A Block Mod`.) Take that folder and put it in QMods.

If all goes well, your mod should load in to the game
